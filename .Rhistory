```
This data set contains 1,599 red wines with 11 variables for the chemical
properties of the wine. At least 3 wine experts rated the quality of each wine,
providing a rating between 0 (very bad) and 10 (very excellent).

ggplot(aes(fixed.acidity), data = rw) +
geom_histogram()
```
Fixed acidity seems somewhat normally distributed, with a slight right skew.
```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
ggplot(aes(volatile.acidity), data = rw) +
geom_histogram()
```
Volatile acidity also seems somewhat normally distributed.
```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
ggplot(aes(citric.acid), data = rw) +
geom_histogram()
```
Wines showed a wide range of citric acid levels.
```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
ggplot(aes(residual.sugar), data = rw) +
geom_histogram()
```
The chart suggests that most wines contained residual sugar a bit less than
2 g / dm^3. However, there were outliers with much higher residual sugar content.
The maximum value was 15. The median residual sugar is 2.2, but the mean value,
2.5, was higher due to the outliers.
```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
ggplot(aes(chlorides), data = rw) +
geom_histogram()
```
The histogram shows most wines in the dataset have chlorides in a narrow range,
with the most frequent value being slightly less than 0.1 g / dm^3. However,
there are some outliers with higher values. The median value is 0.079,
but the mean is influenced by outliers and the slightly higher value of 0.087.
```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
ggplot(aes(free.sulfur.dioxide), data = rw) +
geom_histogram()
```
The distribution of wines by free.sulfur.dioxide appears right skewed. There are
a few outliers with higher values. The mean is 15.87, and median 14.00.
```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
ggplot(aes(total.sulfur.dioxide), data = rw) +
geom_histogram()
```
The distribution of wines by total.sulfur.dioxide appears right skewed, similar
to free.sulfur.dioxide. There are a few outliers. The mean value is 46.47, the
median is 38.00.
```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
ggplot(aes(density), data = rw) +
geom_histogram()
```
The distribution for density appears normal and unimodal. There are relatively
few outliers. The mean value, 0.9967, and median value, 0.9968, are nearly
identical.
```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
ggplot(aes(pH), data = rw) +
geom_histogram()
```
The distribution for pH also appears normal and unimodal. There are a few outliers
on both sides of the distribution. The mean value is 3.311, and the median
value is 3.310.
```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
ggplot(aes(sulphates), data = rw) +
geom_histogram()
```
The distribution appears unimodal and somewhat normal. There are several outliers
toward the right tail. The mean value is 0.6581, and the median is 0.6200.
```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
ggplot(aes(alcohol), data = rw) +
geom_histogram()
```
Most wines appear to have an alcohol content of at least 9 percent of volume,
with higher alcohol content less common. There are a few outliers.
The mean value is 10.42, and the median value is 10.20.
```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
ggplot(aes(quality), data = rw) +
geom_histogram()
```
Although the quality score ranges between 0 and 10, it appears that the dataset
only contains wines with scores between 3 and 8. The overwhelming majority of
wines were in the mid/high-mid range, 5, 6 and some 7.
# Univariate Analysis
### What is the structure of your dataset?
The dataset contains 1599 red wines along with 11 descriptive attributes that
describe the wine, and an output variable with an expert rating indicating
quality on a scale of 0 (very bad) to 10 (very excellent). At least 3 experts
rated each wine.
The dataset includes the attributes below recorded in the respective units. When
the original dataset was loaded into R, the quality variable was type integer,
and all other variables were of type numeric.
1 - fixed acidity (tartaric acid - g / dm^3)
2 - volatile acidity (acetic acid - g / dm^3)
3 - citric acid (g / dm^3)
4 - residual sugar (g / dm^3)
5 - chlorides (sodium chloride - g / dm^3
6 - free sulfur dioxide (mg / dm^3)
7 - total sulfur dioxide (mg / dm^3)
8 - density (g / cm^3)
9 - pH
10 - sulphates (potassium sulphate - g / dm3)
11 - alcohol (% by volume)
Output variable (based on sensory data):
12 - quality (score between 0 and 10)
### What is/are the main feature(s) of interest in your dataset?
The main feature of the dataset is how the quality rating changes as the
chemical properties vary. Which chemical properties appear to influence the
quality of red wines? E.g. Did wines with a higher alcohol content (% by volume)
receive higher quality ratings?
### What other features in the dataset do you think will help support your investigation into your feature(s) of interest?
It may make sense to analyze potentially related variables. For example, perhaps
the dataset shows similar patterns between pH, fixed.acidity, and volatile.acidity
due to these variables all in some form indicating the acidity of the wine.
Similarly, it may be worthwhile to compare free.sulfur.dioxide and
total.sulfur.dioxide.
### Did you create any new variables from existing variables in the dataset?
No, it did not seem necessary to create any new variables.
### Of the features you investigated, were there any unusual distributions? Did you perform any operations on the data to tidy, adjust, or change the form of the data? If so, why did you do this?
Yes, I changed the quality variable to a factor type to ensure that each level
of quality would be plotted in an easy-to-read way for the box plot chart.
# Bivariate Plots Section
```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
ggplot(aes(quality,alcohol), data = rw) +
geom_point(alpha = 1/4, size = 3/4
,position = position_jitter(h = 0)) +
scale_x_continuous(breaks = 1:10)
```
The scatter plot of quality by alcohol content shows that most wines rated with
quality of 5 have alcohol less than 10 percent alcohol content. There seems to
be more variation in alcohol content among wines rated 6 or higher.
```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
ggplot(aes(quality,volatile.acidity), data = rw) +
geom_point(alpha = 1/4, size = 3/4
,position = position_jitter(h = 0)) +
scale_x_continuous(breaks = 1:10)
```
This scatter plot of volatile acidity appears to show a slight decreasing trend,
with wines having less volatile acidity as the rating increases.
```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
rw$quality <- as.factor(rw$quality)
ggplot(aes(quality,volatile.acidity), data = rw) +
geom_boxplot()
```
A boxplot of the same volatile acidity data makes the decreasing trend more
apparent. Volatile acidity decreases as quality increases, and seems to
level-off at a quality score of 7.
```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(gridExtra)
plot1 <- ggplot(aes(quality, fixed.acidity), data = rw) +
geom_point(position = position_jitter(h = 0), alpha = .25)
plot2 <- ggplot(aes(quality, volatile.acidity), data = rw) +
geom_point(position = position_jitter(h = 0), alpha = .25)
plot3 <- ggplot(aes(quality, citric.acid), data = rw) +
geom_point(position = position_jitter(h = 0), alpha = .25)
grid.arrange(plot1, plot2, plot3, nrow = 3)
```
I plotted all "acid" related variables to see if there are any similarities in
distribution. At a glace, the plots for volatile and fixed acidity seem similar,
with most wines scorred 5 or 6 in quality clustering within a narrow range of
acidity. However, the plot for citric acid does not show the same pattern.
```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
plot4 <- ggplot(aes(quality, fixed.acidity), data = rw) +
geom_boxplot()
plot5 <- ggplot(aes(quality, volatile.acidity), data = rw) +
geom_boxplot()
plot6 <- ggplot(aes(quality, citric.acid), data = rw) +
geom_boxplot()
grid.arrange(plot4, plot5, plot6, nrow = 3)
```
The boxplot seems easier to read. The same variables plotted with a boxplots
show that median volatile acidity decreases slightly as quality increases,
whereas median fixed acidity increases slightly as quality increases. Citric
acid shows much wider variance, and the median citric acid g / dm^3 generally
increases as quality score increases.
```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
plot7 <- ggplot(aes(quality, residual.sugar),
data =
subset(rw, residual.sugar < quantile(residual.sugar, 0.95)))
+ geom_boxplot()
plot8 <- ggplot(aes(quality, chlorides),
data = subset(rw, chlorides < quantile(chlorides, 0.95)))
+ geom_boxplot()
grid.arrange(plot7, plot8, nrow = 2)
```
The residual sugar and chlorides in wine both appear to be relatively consistent
across quality scores.
```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
plot9 <- ggplot(aes(quality, free.sulfur.dioxide),
data = subset(rw, free.sulfur.dioxide
< quantile(free.sulfur.dioxide, 0.95)))
+ geom_boxplot()
plot10 <- ggplot(aes(quality, total.sulfur.dioxide),
data = subset(rw, total.sulfur.dioxide
< quantile(total.sulfur.dioxide, 0.95)))
+ geom_boxplot()
grid.arrange(plot9, plot10, nrow = 2)
```
Both free and total sulfer dioxide levels have a fair amount of variance across quality scores.
```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
plot11 <- ggplot(aes(quality, density), data = rw) +
geom_boxplot()
plot12 <- ggplot(aes(quality, pH), data = rw) +
geom_boxplot()
grid.arrange(plot11, plot12, nrow = 2)
```
Density seems relatively consistent across quality scores, with median density
decreasing slightly at the highest quality scores. Likewise, pH shows a similar
pattern, consistent across most scores, a slight decrease in median pH at the
highest quality scores, and higher variance.
```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
plot13 <- ggplot(rw, aes(quality, sulphates)) +
geom_boxplot()
plot14 <- ggplot(rw, aes(quality, alcohol)) +
geom_boxplot()
grid.arrange(plot13, plot14)
```
Median sulphate seemed to increase as quality increased. There were a fair
number of outliers for quality scores 5 and 6.
Median percent alcohol content incdreased as the quality of the wine increased.
This appears to be one of the strongest relationships of any of the attributes
in the dataset.
```{r}
cor.test(rw$alcohol,as.numeric(rw$quality))
```
Although the plots suggest the relationship between alcohol content and quality
may be the strongest, the correlation is only moderately positive, r = ~0.48
# Bivariate Analysis
### Talk about some of the relationships you observed in this part of the investigation. How did the feature(s) of interest vary with other features in the dataset?
I found it interesting that the plots suggest that one of the strongest
relationships is between alcohol content and wine rating. As alcohol content
increased, so did wine rating. Additionally, I found the opposite relationships
between fixed (increased as rating increased) and volatile (decreased as rating
increased) acidity interesting, because both measure acid in some form. However,
from reviewing the notes about high levels of volatile acidity causing an
unpleasant, vinegar taste, so this relationship makes sense.
### Did you observe any interesting relationships between the other features (not the main feature(s) of interest)?
### What was the strongest relationship you found?
The strongest relationship appears to be between wine rating and alcohol content.
As alcohol content increased, so did the rating. The Pearson correlation
coefficient shows a moderately positive relationship (Pearson's product-moment
correlation r = 0.4761663).
# Multivariate Plots Section
```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(RColorBrewer)
ggplot(aes(x = volatile.acidity,
y = fixed.acidity, color = quality), data = rw) +
geom_point(alpha = 0.5, size = 1) +
scale_color_brewer(type = 'seq',
guide = guide_legend(title = 'Quality Rating', reverse = T),
palette = "YlOrRd")
```
This scatter plot of fixed acidity and volatile acidity shows most wines in the
data set clustering within a similar overall range, and higher-rated wines
tending to have lower scores, particularly for volatile acidity, which is
associated with an unpleasant vinegar taste.
```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
ggplot(aes(x = volatile.acidity, y = alcohol, color = quality), data = rw) +
geom_point(alpha = 0.75, size =1) +
scale_color_brewer(type = 'seq',
guide = guide_legend(title = 'Quality Rating', reverse = T),
palette = "YlOrRd")
```
This scatter plot suggests that the highest rated wines tend to have relatively
lower volatile acidity and relatively higher alcohol content.
```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
ggplot(aes(x = volatile.acidity, y = alcohol, color = quality), data = rw) +
geom_line(alpha = 0.75, size =1) +
scale_color_brewer(type = 'seq',
guide = guide_legend(title = 'Quality Rating', reverse = T),
palette = "Accent")
```
The same data charted as a line graph seems overplotted.
```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
ggplot(aes(x = volatile.acidity, y = alcohol, color = quality), data = rw) +
geom_smooth() +
scale_color_brewer(type = 'seq',
guide = guide_legend(title = 'Quality Rating', reverse = T),
palette = "Accent")
```
However, plotting the smoothed conditional mean removes the overplotting and
highlights the trends more clearly. The smoothed plot highlights that higher
quality wines tend to have both higher alcohol content and lower volatile acidity,
although there is some variation.
```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
ggplot(aes(x = residual.sugar, y = citric.acid, color = quality), data = rw) +
geom_point(alpha = 0.75, size =1) +
scale_color_brewer(type = 'seq',
guide = guide_legend(title = 'Quality Rating', reverse = T),
palette = "Paired")
```
Although there don't appear to be any extremely strong relationships, as the
bivariate analysis showed, the highest-rated wines seem to have higher citric acid.
# Multivariate Analysis
### Talk about some of the relationships you observed in this part of the investigation. Were there features that strengthened each other in terms of looking at your feature(s) of interest?
I chose to focus on attributes that stood out in the bivariate analysis. I found
it interesting that plotting both lower volatile acidity and alcohol, the plot
strongly suggests that suggests that the highest rated wines tend to have both
relatively high alcohol but low volatile acidity.
### Were there any interesting or surprising interactions between features?
I did not expect the smoothed plot for volatile acidity and alcohol content to
be helpful, but thought it was good because it draws attentoin to both variation
and the means for alcohol content and volatile acidity.

### Description One
This histogram gives a sense of the number of red wines in the dataset, and
highlights that only part of the ten point rating scale was used. By far the
most frequent ratings are 5 and 6.
### Plot Two
```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, Plot_Two}
ggplot(aes(quality,volatile.acidity), data = rw) +
geom_boxplot() +
xlab("Quality Rating (score between 0 and 10)") +
ylab("Volatile Acidity (acetic acid - g / dm^3)") +
ggtitle("Quality Rating and Volatile Acidity")
```
### Description Two
This boxplot shows that higher rated wines tend to have lower amounts of volatile
acidity.
### Plot Three
```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, Plot_Three}
ggplot(aes(x = volatile.acidity, y = alcohol, color = quality), data = rw) +
geom_smooth() +
scale_color_brewer(type = 'seq',
guide = guide_legend(title = 'Quality Rating', reverse = T),

ylab("Alcohol (% by volume)") +
xlab("Volatile Acidity (acetic acid - g / dm^3)") +
ggtitle("Mean of Quality Rating (score 0 to 10) by Alcohol, and Volatile Acidity")
```
### Description Three
This smoothed conditional mean of quality rating by alcohol and volatile acidity
shows that the highest rated wines tend to have both the highest alcohol content
and the lowest volatile acidity.

# Reflection
Working through the exploratory data analysis project I ocassionally ran into
difficulties with the syntax and data types needed to create the plots I intended.
However, through researching and reviewing the course notes I was usually able to
find a way to put together an appropriate plot.
The analysis provides a good high level introduction to the dataset and possible
relationships. Next steps for the analysis could include building a regression
model to predict wine quality based on input of various chemical attributes.
